# Portfolio-Analysis

The main .ipynb file provides the objective analysis of a set of portfolio in relation to a benchmark (S&P TSX 60 in this case).

Comparisons such as the Daily Returns, Cummulative daily returns, Rolling Statistics and Sharpe Ratios were made on the portfolio set.

Here are some screenshots of the analysis:
